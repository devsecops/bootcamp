##### Regarding attack maps best practices, is there an online resource where we could view different types of attack maps?  I'm especially curious on attacks involving a third-party CDN.

##### What are the best practices regarding users, and how do you help prevent users from being the biggest threat to a system's security?

##### How do you balance operational needs and security?

##### What are flaws of traditional auditing that can be easily solved with devsecops?

##### What is the 'rugged' software movement?
At its core, the rugged software movement is about writing software in such a way that it is robust to being used in unanticipated ways.  See https://www.ruggedsoftware.org.  Obviously, secure software is rugged software.

##### What is a starting resource for learning more about the types of attacks and vulnerables web-accessible application need to worry about?
While there are a lot of various resources, both on and offline, one very good starting point is the [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) wiki run by the Open Web Application Security Project.
OWASP even includes a Ruby on Rails-specific listing of common pitfalls of Rails-based applications as the [Ruby on Rails Cheatsheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ruby_on_Rails_Cheatsheet)
